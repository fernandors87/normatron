h1. Normatron

Normatron is an attribute normalizer for ActiveRecord objects.
With it you can convert attributes to the desired format before saving them in the database.
This gem inhibits the work of having to override attributes or create a specific method to perform most of the normalizations.

h2. Installation

Let the bundler install the gem by adding the following into your application gemfile:

<pre>gem 'normatron'</pre>

And then bundle it up:

<pre>$ bundle install</pre>

Or install it by yourself:

<pre>$ gem install normatron</pre>

h2. The problem

Suppose you have a product model as the following:

<pre>
# ./db/migrate/20120101010000_create_products.rb
class CreateProducts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :products do |t|
      t.string  :name
      t.decimal :price, :precision => 10, :scale => 2
    end
  end
end

# ./app/models/products.rb
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :price
end
</pre>

And you want the _name_ attribute be uppercased before saving it into the database.
The most usual approach to do this includes:

* Override the _name_ setter and convert the value to an uppercased string.
* Use the _before_validation_ callback to run a method or block doing the task.

Both ways are ilenegant, boring, error prone and very expensive.
What led me to make this gem and offer a third way to solve the problem:

h2. Usage

h3. The default filters

Normatron uses *:squish* and *:blank* as default filters.
These filters are applied to all attributes in *normalize* function, since no options was given.

<pre>
# ./app/models/products.rb
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :price
  normalize :name
end

 $ rails console
 > p = Product.create name: "  memory   card    "
 > p.name
=> "memory card"
 > p = Product.create name: "    "
 > p.name
=> nil
</pre>

You can also apply the default filters to multiple attributes as following:

<pre>normalize :login, :email, :address, :city</pre>

h3. The callback

All filters are automatically applyied in the *before_validation* callback.
So, the changes occur when you call any method that validates de model.

<pre>
 $ rails console
 > p = Product.create name: "mouse"
 > p.name
=> "MOUSE"
 > p = Product.new name: "keyboard"
 > p.valid?
 > p.name
=> "KEYBOARD"
 > p = Product.new name: "dvd"
 > p.save
 > p.name
=> "DVD"
</pre>

It's possible to call the *apply_normalizations* method. That perform the normalization without do the validations.

<pre>
 > p = Product.new name: "hd"
 > p.apply_normalizations
 > p.name
=> "HD"
</pre>

h3. Specifying filters

Just add the *:with* option and pass the filter you want.
All Symbols outside the *:with* Hash are flagged as an attribute.

<pre>normalize :login, :address, :city, :with => :upcase</pre>

To apply multiple filters, pass it as an array:

<pre>
normalize :login, :address, :city, :with => [:upcase, :blank, :strip]
normalize :email, :with => [:downcase, :blank, :strip]
</pre>

h3. Mixing all together

You can stack filters to an attribute calling the *normalize* method multiple times.

<pre>
# ./app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :surname, :login, :password, :email

  normalize :name, :surname, :email, :login, :with => [:blank, :squish]
  normalize :name, :surname, :with => :upcase
  normalize :email, :with => :downcase
end

 $ rails console
 > u = User.new
 > u.name = "  \n \f \r \t  "
 > u.surname = "  norris  "
 > u.login = "          iKICKasses"
 > u.email = "GMAIL@CHUCKNORRIS.COM"
 > u.valid?
 > u
=> #<User id: nil, name: nil, surname: "NORRIS", login: "iKICKasses", email: "gmail@chucknorris.com">
</pre>

h3. Using custom instance method as a filter

<pre>
# ./app/models/client.rb
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :phone

  normalize :phone, :with => :my_phone_filter

  def my_phone_filter(value)
    digits = value.gsub(/[^\d]/, '')
    "(%s) %s-%s" % [digits[0..1], digits[2..5], digits[6..9]]
  end
end

$ rails console
> p = Client.create :name => "Jim Raynor", :phone => " a1b c2d e3f g4h i5j k6l m7n o8p q9r s1t "
> p.phone
=> "(12) 3456-7891"
</pre>

Create an instance method that returns the value as you want. The method must have an unique mandatory parameter.

This gem was inspired on work of "fnando (fnando's Github)":https://github.com/fnando called "normalize_attributes (normalize_attributes gem)":https://github.com/fnando/normalize_attributes.
He have a lot of interesting gems on his repo, please take a look.
